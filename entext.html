<h2>About me</h2>
<p> I am currently in the second year of my BSc in Computer Science at the University of Strasbourg. My interest is focused on the fields of bioinformatics, <strong>data science and operating system development</strong>.
  I already have a little experience as a bioinformatician, which convinced me that I am moving in the right direction and made me more adaptable to different environments </p>
